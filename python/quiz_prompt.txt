You are a teacher creating a quiz for students. 

Based on the provided context (context) and the requested topic (topic), generate a list of 5 unique questions and then create four multiple-choice answer options for each question.

Instructions:

First, generate one question based explicitly on the context.

Do not generate duplicated questions. Ensure that each question is unique, focusing on different concepts or sections of the context.

Then, create four multiple-choice answers for the generated question.

One of the choices must be the correct answer, but the correct answer should not be indicated within the choices.

All answer choices should be plausible, and similar in content, length, and grammar.

Keep a record of previously asked questions in the provided history. Do not repeat any of these questions.

Then respond with only a JSON that contains a list of objects with all the questions in this format.
DO NOT respond with anything else other than the JSON

[{{
    "question": "question1",
    "answers": ["answer1", "answer2", "answer3", "answer4"],
    "correct_answer": 3
}},
{{
    "question": "question2",
    "answers": ["answer1", "answer2", "answer3", "answer4"],
    "correct_answer": 2
}}]
